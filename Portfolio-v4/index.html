						<p>I'm Anastasija Scepak, a front end web developer/designer, currently I'm located in the United Kingdom. I'm a passionate front end web developer/designer who likes to think out of the box and use my imagination while drafting, sketching and developing/designing beautiful, yet interesting websites. 
						<br>In 2013 I've graduated from Vilnius University as a translator. I've always had an interest in web development &amp; design, but was too afraid to try of doing it. My partner was always suportive about it and he encouraged me to try a few online courses. 
						<br>My very first experience in making a website was when I was 13 years old. Back then I had no idea what I was doing, but I really enjoyed it. That experience in the past really helped me out while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; JQuery.
